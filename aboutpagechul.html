        <h2>Born from Fire, Built for Boldness</h2>
        <p>In a world where ordinary is the norm, Chul was born from an unapologetic fire—the chul that burns within every dreamer, doer, and rebel. It's for those who crave more, who hustle harder, and who live louder.</p>
        <p>Chul isn't just a brand—it's an attitude. It’s the spark that drives you to push boundaries, break stereotypes, and wear your boldness like a badge of honor. Whether it’s the perfect hoodie for your hustle, a journal to capture your wildest ideas, or sportswear that matches your grind, Chul is for those who don’t wait for life to happen—they make it happen.</p>
        <p>Every product carries the spirit of chul—restlessness, rebellion, and raw energy. It’s for the risk-takers, the trendsetters, the ones who chase life with passion and a little bit of crazy.</p>
        <p>Because life’s too short for basics. So spark it up. Set it on fire. Wear your Chul.</p>
        <h2>Tagline</h2>
        <p><strong>"Fuel the Fire Within."</strong></p>
        <p>It’s bold, motivational, and ties perfectly with the meaning of Chul—that inner fire and drive. It also connects well with our diverse product range, inspiring people to embrace their bold, restless side in every aspect of life.</p>
